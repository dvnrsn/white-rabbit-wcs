# White Rabbit - Design Mood Boards

Four Matrix-inspired design concepts for the White Rabbit WCS community site.

## View the Mood Boards

Open `index.html` in your browser to see all concepts, or view them individually:

1. **Classic Matrix** (`01-classic-matrix.html`) - Pure Matrix aesthetic with electric green on black
2. **White Rabbit** (`02-white-rabbit.html`) - Refined white/green combination, more accessible
3. **Neo-Modern** (`03-neo-modern.html`) - Contemporary teal/blue gradients, 2025-ready
4. **Minimal Matrix** (`04-minimal-matrix.html`) - Subtle and elegant, production-ready

## Features

Each mood board includes:
- Live typing animations
- Matrix-inspired visual effects
- Color palette
- Typography samples
- Interaction examples
- Design philosophy

## Quick Start

```bash
# Option 1: Open directly in browser
open moodboards/index.html

# Option 2: Use Python simple server
cd moodboards
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080

# Option 3: Use the Astro dev server (serves all files)
pnpm dev
# Then visit http://localhost:4321/moodboards/
```

## Next Steps

After reviewing the mood boards, choose a direction and we can:
1. Integrate the chosen design into the Astro project
2. Create reusable components based on the aesthetic
3. Build out the actual site pages with the selected theme
